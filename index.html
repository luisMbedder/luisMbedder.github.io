<p>My name is Luis Marquez, I am a software engineer currently focusing on embedded programming and expanding my skill set
  to mobile and web development. I created this site to document my learning experience and showcase some neat open source projects 
  along the way.

<p>In 2011 I graduated from the New Mexico Institute of Technology with a B.Sc. in electrical engineering. I was lucky enough to have this great engineering school 
just an hour away from my hometown of Albuquerque. Here I developed a strong interest in software development and was 
always the volunteer firmware guy for our academic projects. Shortly after graudating I moved to New England to begin 
my career as a software engineer and have been working professionally for 3+ years on embedded controls software. 
It has been a really great learning experience so far and I have become well versed with software in every stage of the
development life cycle which has made me a very well-rounded software engineer. My primary passion currently is in 
embedded software, although my interests are not limited to just that field. I have also spent some time creating 
mobile phone applications and I am always busy working on personal projects as a hobby and to expand my skill set.
