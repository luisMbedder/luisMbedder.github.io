          <p>My name is Luis Marquez, I am a software engineer currently focusing on embedded programming and expanding my skill set
            to mobile and web development. I created this site to document my learning experience and showcase some neat open source projects 
            along the way. 
          </p>

          <h3><a name="about-me" class="anchor" href="#about-me"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Me</h3>

          <p>In 2011 I graduated from the New Mexico Institute of Technology with a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering. I was lucky enough to have this great engineering school 
          just an hour away from my hometown of Albuquerque. There I developed a strong interest in software development and always volunteered to be the firmware guy for 
          our group projects. I knew that once I graduated I wanted to do software!</p>


          <p>Shortly after graudating I moved to New England to begin 
          my career as a software engineer and have been working professionally for 3+ years on embedded controls software. 
          It has been a great learning experience and I have become well versed with software in every stage of the
          development life cycle, which has made me a very well-rounded engineer. My primary passion currently is in 
          embedded software, although my interests are not limited to just that field. I have also spent some time creating 
          mobile phone applications and I am always busy working on personal projects both as a hobby and to expand my skill set.
