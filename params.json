{"name":"dontmitch","tagline":"a junior dev hoping to make a splash","body":"##Mitch Lee\r\n---\r\n\r\nMy name is Mitch, and I used to be a mechanical engineer. At least, that was what I formally studied in college and - for two short years - practiced at Boeing Defense.\r\n\r\nNow, I am a recent graduate of Dev Bootcamp hoping to make a splash as a developer. How did I get from point A to point B you ask? Read onâ€¦\r\n\r\n###About Me\r\n\r\nI was fortunate enough to know from a young age that I wanted to be an engineer. The engineering mindset and way of thinking came naturally to me. What I didn't know was what type of engineer I wanted to be. When push came to shove, I chose mechanical engineering because it was the most noncommittal.\r\n\r\nTruth be told, what I really enjoy, and what I really want to do, is learn. When I graduated from Northwestern and took a job as a stress analyst at Boeing Defense, I loved it. I was learning every single day. I was watching military helicopters - my daily work - fly overhead on my walk in. How could anyone not love that?\r\n\r\nBut then, in late 2012, the realization that I was becoming too specialized too quickly washed over me. Less than two years into my job and I already had two patents to my name. I was useful to no more than five or six other companies in the world. And that meant that, as a 23 year old, I was immobile.\r\n\r\nAfter some introspection, I decided to pivot away from that career to something else that I loved equally as much: programming. A year later, I realized that relegating my learning to nights and weekends wasn't going to get me a job at as a programmer. I need something more.\r\n\r\nSo I turned to Dev Bootcamp, and learned more than I could ever have imagined was possible in nine (actually twelve - there was an optional fourth phase that I couldn't resist) weeks.\r\n\r\nAnd now - now I am a junior developer eager (and when I say eager, I mean *EAGER* ) to continue learning as fast as my mind will allow me to learn.\r\n\r\n###My Interests\r\n\r\nIf my about **About Me** did not get this point accross, allow me to bash you over the head with it: I love learning. To that end, many of my interests involve learning or, relatedly, experiencing new things. Traveling is a great example. In 2012 I went on over two dozen trips, because I love traveling and seeing new places. I love eating at places that I've never eaten at - in fact, I tend to avoid places that I've already been once.\r\n\r\nI'd rather read a book or skim the coverage of a new technology than watch TV. I'd rather build something using a raspberry pi than catch up on celebrity gossip. I'd rather solve logic problems than think about fashion. No one option is better than the other, but that's just who I am.\r\n\r\nOh, and I also love triathlons.\r\n\r\n###My Skills\r\n\r\nBy the time you're reading this, I'm sure that I will have dramatically expanded upon my knowledge one or more of these, if not added more to the list. However, for now bear in mind the fact that I am a beginner (albeit with the mentality of a trained engineer).\r\n\r\n#####Ruby | Rails | JavaScript | jQuery | CSS | HTML\r\n\r\n###More\r\nFor boring resume-type things like education and job history, feel free to check out my equally borning linkedIn page [here](www.linkedin.com/in/mitchjlee/).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
